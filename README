critbit trees for fixed length data
===================================

This is an adaptation of the original crit-bit code to fixed length byte-strings
(instead of null-terminated character strings). The length is specified when
the tree is created. The original PDF is left as reference but obviously no
longer reflects the current state of the code.

Original README
---------------
This code is taken from Dan Bernstein's qhasm and implements a binary
crit-bit (also known as PATRICA) tree for |NUL| terminated strings. Crit-bit
trees are underused and it's this author's hope that a good example will aid
their adoption.

Herein is the CWEB source (critbit.w) and the derived files (critbit.pdf and
critbit.c) for those who don't wish to install CWEB and/or TeX.

If in doubt, read the PDF file.
